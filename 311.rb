# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
g = "atlanta"
i = "chicago"
m = "sharon"
puts "I currently live in " + g + " but am dorming in " + i + " my cousins live in " + m
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? yes 
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. more on loops still need that practice
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
