# QUESTION 1
# Ancay ouyay igurefay histay neoay utoay?
# Pig Latin is a very sophisticated language in which 
# each English word is converted as follows: 
# The first letter of each word is removed from the beginning and added to the end. 
# Then, the letters 'ay' are added to the very end of the word.
# For example: hello = ellohay, pingpong = ingpongpay, marmalade = armalademay, etc.
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a single word 
# and prints out the Pig Latin version of that word.

# ask the user to enter a word then print it
# puts "please type a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts  word.split

# make a new string
# puts "please type a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word 
# new_string = "ay"
# puts new_string

# combind a string with a word
# new_string = "ay"
# word = "meow" 
# puts word + new_string

# split a String
# word = "meow"
# p word.split(//)
# p word.length

# add something to the letters in the Array
# word = "meow"
# p word.split(//)
# new_array = word.split(//)
# index = 0
# while index < word.length
#   puts new_array[index] + "ay"
#   index = index + 1
# end

# call on the first letter of the array/ word 
#  word = "meow"
# p word.split(//)
# new_array = word.split(//)
# p new_array[0] 

# add the first letter to the end of the word
word = "meow"
p word.split(//)
new_array = word.split(//)
p new_array[0] 
# i got stuck here
