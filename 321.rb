# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a while loop that prints the numbers 0 through 100, increasing by 5 each time.

index = 0 
while index <= 100
  puts index 
  index = index + 5
end  

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? no
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# i got confused by what it was asking and put times 5 instead of plus idk how to practice fixing that....
