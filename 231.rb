# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.# Create an array to store 5 numbers. Then print out each number on separate lines with a while loop.
qwerty = [4,2,66,24,71]
index = 0 
while index < qwerty.length
puts qwerty[index]
  index = index + 1
end
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? yes 
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. more and harder arrays 
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
