# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a while loop that prints the phrase "Around the world" 144 times.
number = 0
while number < 144
  puts "around the world"
  number = number + 1 
end
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? for the most part but I just forgot to use a 0 instead of 1 and <=
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. I want to continue loops to make sure I have it downpact but use a harder loop 
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
