      <h2>Where I grew up</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Atlanta Georgia with my family. I have 2 younger siblings age 16 and 18. We are all close in age and used to fight 24/7. Now that we are teens we have so much fun together and barley fight. Lets just say my parents have it a lot easier now. </p>

  <h2>Some cool things abobut Atlanta</h2>
  Atlanta is where coke was invented and my school made a play about the invention of coke. We also have stone moutain which is good for hiking. Thats if its not too hot. I enjoy getting out and excersising. We have a pool so I swim a lot and its so fun. We also have the worlds busiest airport since the Delta hub is located here. The airport is huge and theres always airport traffic.
